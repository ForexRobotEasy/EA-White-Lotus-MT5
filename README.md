This code represents an Expert Advisor (EA) called White Lotus MT5, developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. The EA is designed to automate trading in the MetaTrader 5 platform.

## Functionality

The EA uses a neural network to determine the short-term price direction in the market. Based on the determined price direction, the EA opens new positions. The number of positions opened in one series is determined by the `maxDeals` input variable, which is set to 3 by default.

The EA also includes a function called 'Reverse Without Loss' which can be enabled using the `reverseWithoutLoss` input variable. This function is responsible for reversing positions without incurring any losses.

## How it Works

The EA works by monitoring the open positions in the market. If there are no open positions, it calls the `DeterminePriceDirection` function to determine the price direction using the neural network. Based on the determined price direction, the EA opens new positions using the `OpenPositions` function.

The `OpenPositions` function calculates the lot size based on the account's free margin and opens positions with the specified parameters, including the order type (buy or sell), lot size, stop loss, and take profit levels.

The `DeterminePriceDirection` function calls the neural network's `DeterminePriceDirection` function to determine the short-term price direction. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the price is predicted to go up or down.

If the `reverseWithoutLoss` function is enabled, the EA includes the `ReverseWithoutLoss` function. However, the code implementation for this function is not provided in this sample.
